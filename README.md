### Overview
The Arm Corstone family is designed to help reduce design complexity and speed time –to market. Corstone balances trade-offs between performance and energy efficiency by providing a large amount of software, IP blocks, and a configurable, modifiable, heterogeneous subsystem.

* SoC designers use Arm Corstone as a framework to build an SoC using the modifiable, configurable, heterogenous subsystem.
* Software developers use Corstone software components and tools to get started with the software development before the hardware is ready.

## Corstone-300

Reference: https://developer.arm.com/Processors/Corstone-300

### Overview
A reference package to help SoC designers build Cortex-M55 based systems faster. Corstone-300 combines an example subsystem, complementary System IP, and software and tools to streamline SoC development. Corstone-300 leverages Cortex-M55, Arm's most AI capable Cortex-M CPU, and allows for straightforward integration of the Ethos-U55 NPU to build low-power, high-performance endpoint AI systems.
