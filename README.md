## Corstone-1000 

Reference: https://developer.arm.com/Processors/Corstone-1000

* The Arm Corstone family is designed to help reduce design complexity and speed time –to market. 
* Corstone balances trade-offs between performance and energy efficiency by providing a large amount of software, IP blocks, and a configurable, modifiable, heterogeneous subsystem.
* SoC designers use Arm Corstone as a framework to build an SoC using the modifiable, configurable, heterogenous subsystem.
* Software developers use Corstone software components and tools to get started with the software development before the hardware is ready.
